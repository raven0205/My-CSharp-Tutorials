## Tutorial - Exercise scenario
Suppose you’re helping a non-profit company with a software project. You have experience creating structured apps in C#, but no experience with object-oriented programming. You need to gain experience before starting work on the company software. You decide to create a simple banking app that includes “BankCustomer” and “BankAccount” classes.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

* Create a console app and a class named BankCustomer.
* Update the Program.cs file to create instances of the BankCustomer class.
* Add public fields and updated constructors to the BankCustomer class.
* Update the BankCustomer class using static members to ensure unique customer IDs.
* Create a class named BankAccount that implements private, public, and static members.
